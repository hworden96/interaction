# interaction
Program to calculate concentrations/volumes/dilutions for MDA-MB-231 interaction with functionalized platelets
By inputting the starting concentration of functionalized platelets and starting concentration of MDA cells, this program outputs the dilution factors, concentrations, and volumes of each component of the interaction experiment.
